# Facebook's Conversions API Tag for Google Tag Manager(server-side)

The Conversions API allows advertisers to send web events from their servers directly to Facebook. Server events are linked to a pixel and are processed like browser pixel events. This means that server events are used in measurement, reporting, and optimization in the same way as browser pixel events. [Learn More](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api).

Google Tag Manager(GTM) have released support for their [server-side](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/serverside/) support for sharing customer actions with analytics partners directly from Advertisers' servers.

This template is a tag that reads the standard event schema thatâ€™s sent from the client running on a tagging server (such as [Conversions API Client for server-side implementation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/ConversionsAPI-Client-for-GoogleTagManager)). It then converts events to the appropriate schema and sends them through Conversions API.

(This feature may not be available to you. Contact your Facebook representative for more details.)
